about.innerHTML=This site is redundant. Just so you know it.<br/><b>Attentions:</b> the tweets generated by this site may not appeal to your twitter followers!<br/>This website removes or replaces randomly chosen (by <a href="http://random.org">random.org</a>) words or letters in your text. After clicking "Cheese!" you'll get a preview and with the "tweet this!" button you can tweet the message. Only after explicitly posting the tweet to Twitter with a twitter sharing page it actually appears in your follower's timeline.<br/>If you're not happy with the result, you can re-run the generator by clicking "Try again". You can adjust your text and the settings.<br/>&copy; 2012 by Martin Giger.
